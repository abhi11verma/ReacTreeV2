## <b>Overview</b>
This is the fixed and customized version of original Repository https://github.com/oslabs-beta/ReacTree/
<br>
As the original extension stopped working, have forked and continued the enhancements. Thanks to the original contributor for the project. (check below)
</br>

## <b>Installation</b>

The ReacTreeV2 extension can be easily installed via the <a href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=abhi11verma.reactreev2'>VS Code Marketplace</a>. Bring up the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code or by using the View: Extensions command (Ctrl+Shift+X). Type ‘reacTreeV2’ in the search box and select the Install button. VS Code will download and install the extension from the Marketplace.

## <b>Usage</b>

Instead of selecting a file from the browser now it supports the current open active editor window when the "View Tree" in the nav bar is clicked.
A tree is generated if the ReacTree window is not opened or brought in focus if its already generated.
